> ## What is SurveyUs?
> This app contains the bonus alterations made to the SurveyUs app for my resubmission to General Assembly. My main alterations involve adding an authenticated CRUD object in the form of Cheese Wheels. Some styling has been injected as well.

> ## Future Iterations
>> - Actual styling
>> - Conversion to React Hooks
>> - More Interactivity with the cheesewheels
>> - Somehow make the cheesewheels relevant to the surveying
>> 
>> ### Problems Encountered
>>> - **Problem**
>>>> - When beginning this bonus project, I had commenced work in the new styling branch of the original app. This sent me down a week long rabbit hole of attempts to convert our original code to use React Hooks for simplicity. 7 tutorials and too many days later, I realized I needed to rewrite the cheesewheel front-end to work with the original front end app for timely submittal.
